# Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms learn important classes of repeated games optimally - theoretical and empirical analysis
Research files concerning the results in my current paper.

In the folder "Experiment 1 - Bellman Error" one can find the first experiment's Bellman Errors. Each file in the folder represents the experimental results for different values v1, v2, v3 and v4 in the payoff matrix of the corresponding game.

The folder "Experiment 1 - Q Loss" analogously contains the experiments' Q Losses as defined by the corresponding paper.

The folder "Experiment 2 - Losses and Errors" contains all experimental results of the second experiment.
