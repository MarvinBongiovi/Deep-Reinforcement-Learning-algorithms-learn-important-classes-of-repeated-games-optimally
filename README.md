# Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms learn important classes of repeated games optimally - theoretical and empirical analysis
Research files concerning the results in my current paper.

In the folder "Experiment 1 - Bellman Error" one can find the first experiment's Bellman Errors. Each file in the folder represents the experimental results for different values v_1, v_2, v_3 and v_4 in the payoff matrix of the corresponding game.

The folder "Experiment 1 - Q Loss" analogously contains the experiments' Q Losses as defined by the corresponding paper.

The folder "Experiment 2 - Losses and Errors" contains all experimental results of the second experiment.
